**This repository contains the source code for the NuvlaBox VPN client - the microservice that starts the vpn client
 in the [NuvlaBox](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview).**

This microservice is an integral component of the NuvlaBox Engine.

---

**NOTE:** this microservice is part of a loosely coupled architecture, thus when deployed by itself, it might not provide all of its functionalities. Please refer to https://github.com/nuvlabox/deployment for a fully functional deployment

## Build the NuvlaBox VPN Client

This repository is already linked with Travis CI, so with every commit, a new Docker image is released. 

There is a [POM file](pom.xml) which is responsible for handling the multi-architecture and stage-specific builds.

**If you're developing and testing locally in your own machine**, simply run `docker build .` or even deploy the microservice via the local [compose files](docker-compose.yml) to have your changes built into a new Docker image, and saved into your local filesystem.

**If you're developing in a non-master branch**, please push your changes to the respective branch, and wait for Travis CI to finish the automated build. You'll find your Docker image in the [nuvladev](https://hub.docker.com/u/nuvladev) organization in Docker hub, names as _nuvladev/vpn-client:\<branch\>_.

### Prerequisites 

 - *Docker (version 18 or higher)*
